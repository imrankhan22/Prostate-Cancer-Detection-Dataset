## Introduction

This repository provides insights into prostate cancer detection through in-depth data analysis, machine learning techniques, and a comparison of biopsy results. The goal is to enhance understanding and contribute to the field of prostate cancer diagnostics.

## Task 1: Data Analysis and Machine Learning Task

We initiate our analysis by importing necessary libraries, loading data, conducting exploratory data analysis, and visualizing the data. This task aims to answer the following questions:

1. Review and analyze the dataset.
2. Apply machine learning algorithms (SVM and Naive Bayes) and compare their results.
3. Compare systematic biopsy (SB) and MRI-targeted biopsy (TB) results using a machine learning model.

For a detailed guide on how to run this analysis, refer to the [Task 1 README](/task1/README.md).

## Task 2: Machine Learning Task

In this task, we delve deeper into applying machine learning to the dataset. We focus on Gleason scores and PIRADS grading to predict prostate cancer detection using SVM and Naive Bayes classification algorithms.

For a detailed guide on how to run this analysis and access the machine learning code, refer to the [Task 2 README](/task2/README.md).

## Task 3: Comparison of Biopsy Results

Task 3 involves comparing systematic biopsy (SB) and MRI-targeted biopsy (TB) results using a machine learning model, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The aim is to demonstrate if a comparison is feasible using this approach.

For a detailed guide on how to run this comparison analysis and access the machine learning code, refer to the [Task 3 README](/task3/README.md).
